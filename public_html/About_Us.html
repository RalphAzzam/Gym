                <div id="disc"> FITin began as World Gym in 1979 and has always been a favorite of different types of athletes and fitness enthusiasts.
                    Refined and updated to offer a setting that is open and light where both staff and clientele are friendly and casual and the focus is on well-balanced health.
                    In a pleasant and inviting, 8000 sq. foot facility. 
                    we provide an atmosphere that is positive and relaxed - with very reasonable rates.
                    We keep our focus on the individual attention to a few clients interested in a balanced, healthy lifestyle, not thousands of members.
                    The club comes complete with top of the line equipment, including cardio machines, free-weights, solectorized weight machines, balance and stretching equipment, a yoga and martial arts studio, a massage studio and flat screen Tvs on the channels of your choice.
                    Upstairs a full line of LifeFitness and Precor cardio machines, free-weights, balance equipment, and solectorized weight equipment ensures that you never wait to use a machine.
                    Downstairs are more free-weights and HammerStrength plate loaded pieces to give you a complete workout. After your workout or yoga class any of our highly skilled certified massage therapists can complete your bodywork by re-energizing your sore muscles using healing techniques from painless rolfing to neuromuscular reprogramming in our new massage room.</div>
